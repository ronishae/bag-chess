        <h1>Bag Chess Rules</h1>

        <!-- Rule 1: The Move Bag -->
        <section class="rule-card">
            <h2>1. Move Bag</h2>
            <p>
                You can only move pieces that are in your "move bag."
                It initially starts with every normal* (see change 2) piece. 
                When that piece moves, it is taken out of the move bag.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of your turn, if the move bag is empty, or contains only pieces with no legal
                moves, then the move bag is refilled again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Move bags are displayed on each player's side of the chess board.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Rule 2: The Flag Bearer -->
        <section class="rule-card">
            <h2>2. New Piece: Flag Bearer</h2>
            <p>
                It looks like a pawn with a flag.
                Each player has two, replacing the pawns in front of each rook.
            </p>
            <p>
                It moves like a rook, except it can <b>pass through friendly pieces</b>, and
                it <b>cannot capture or give check/checkmate</b>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The flag bearer is <b>exempt from the bag rule</b>, and can be moved regardless of the bag's state.
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight-text">
                <b>The flag bearer will move a passenger with it when it moves.</b>
                The passenger is the friendly piece immediately behind 
                (opposite to the direction of movement) the flag bearer.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The passenger cannot be a pawn. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                If the passenger is a king, even if the squares in between are
                attacked, the move is still legal, as long as the king's ending square is not attacked.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                If there is no space for the passenger at the destination, or there is no passenger, 
                the flag bearer will move alone.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Rule 3: Bag-Mate -->
        <section class="rule-card">
            <h2>3. New Win Condition: "Bagmate"</h2>
            <p> This is a special win condition for this variant! 
                <b>You win if it is your opponent's turn and they have no legal moves 
                because none of their surviving pieces have bag move rights.</b>
                This occurs when you capture the last remaining piece 
                type with available moves in their bag. 
            </p>
            <p>
                How it works: Your opponent may still have pieces on the board (like a King and a Bishop), 
                but if they have already used their "King move" and "Bishop move" rights, 
                their bag is empty for those pieces. 
                
                If their Flag Bearer also has no moves (e.g. both are captured), 
                they are "stranded" -- no legal moves.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight-text">
                <b>This is not a draw!</b> 
                They failed to manage their move bag. 
                This is a win for you.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Clarifications -->
        <section class="rule-card clarification">
            <h2>Clarifications</h2>
            <p>
                Even if a piece cannot move because it is not in the move bag, it is still able to give check / checkmate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flag bearer may bring passengers with it even when travelling through pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                The passenger's bag state is irrelevant when carried by the flag bearer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Castling is considered a king move only. The rook's bag state is irrelevant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auto-queen is enabled.
