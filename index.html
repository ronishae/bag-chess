        <h1>Bag Chess Rules</h1>
        <p>Rules are the same to normal chess with 2 main changes.</p>
        <h2>1. You can only move pieces that are in your "move bag"</h2>
        <p>
            It initially starts with every normal* (see change 2) piece. 
            When that piece moves, it is taken out of the move bag.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the move bag is empty, or contains only pieces with no legal
            moves, then the move bag is refilled again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Move bags are displayed on each player's side of the chess board.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. New piece: the flag bearer</h2>
        <p>
            It looks like a pawn with a flag.
            Each player has two, replacing the pawns in front of each rook.
        </p>
        <p>
            It moves like a rook, except it can <b>pass through friendly</b> pieces, and
            it <b>cannot capture or give check/checkmate</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The flag bearer is exempt from the bag rule, and can be moved regardless of the bag's state.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            The flag bearer will move a passenger with it when it moves.
        </h3>

        <p>
            The passenger is the friendly piece immediately behind (opposite to the direction of movement) the flag bearer.
        </p>

        <p>
            The passenger cannot be a pawn. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If the passenger is a king, even if the squares in between are
            attacked, the move is still legal, as long as the king's ending square is not attacked.
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is no space for the passenger at the destination, or there is no passenger, 
            the flag bearer will move alone.
        </p>

        <h2>Clarifications</h2>
        <p>
            Even if a piece cannot move because it is not in the move bag, it is still able to give check / checkmate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flag bearer may bring passengers with it even when travelling through pieces.
        </p>
